# 8. Create a project using Webpack

Without reusing create-react-app or the code from the previous exercise, start a brand new npm project

Reusing what you learned during the Webpack module:

    - Set up a system to output a bundle.js file in a dist folder
    - Set up a dev server with hot reloading
    - Create a src folder that will contain your Javascript
    - Set up a simple html file in the dist folder that will import the bundle file in the body tag.

Install and configure the various plugins to support:

    - inline source map
    - style loader
    - css loader
    - image webpack loader
